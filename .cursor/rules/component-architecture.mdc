**Trackure Component Guidelines:**

*   **Composition over Inheritance:** Build UI by composing Shadcn/ui primitives and custom components.
*   **Props for Data:** Pass data down via props. Keep props interfaces clear and well-typed (TypeScript).
*   **Hooks for Logic:** Use custom hooks or built-in React hooks for state and side effects.
*   **Atomic Components:** Utilize core Shadcn UI components (`Button`, `Input`, `Card`, etc.) consistently.
*   **Presentational vs. Container (Conceptual):** Separate components primarily concerned with display (presentational) from those handling data fetching and logic (container-like, often page-level or feature entry points using query hooks).
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure components are accessible (proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management). Leverage Shadcn's accessibility foundation.
*   **Styling:** Apply styles primarily via Tailwind utility classes within the component file. Adhere to the dark theme defined in `tailwind.config.js`.

**Goal:** Create a consistent, maintainable, and accessible component library tailored for Trackure.
