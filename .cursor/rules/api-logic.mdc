**Trackure API/Backend Logic Standards:**

1.  **Input Validation:** ALL API endpoints MUST validate incoming request bodies/parameters using **Zod**. Reject invalid requests early with clear error messages (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
2.  **Authentication & Authorization:** Every endpoint MUST verify user authentication (via Supabase session) and perform necessary RBAC checks (Owner vs. Worker) before proceeding.
3.  **Error Handling:** Implement consistent error handling. Return meaningful HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500). Log errors server-side (integrate with Sentry/logging service).
4.  **Clear Responses:** Return predictable JSON responses, including success/error status and relevant data or error messages.
5.  **Service Layer:** For complex operations, consider extracting business logic into reusable service functions called by the API route handlers.
6.  **Use Edge Functions:** For logic needing low latency DB access or specific runtimes (e.g., complex PDF generation), consider Supabase Edge Functions.

**Goal:** Ensure backend endpoints are secure, robust, validated, and provide clear responses.
